The lifetime of the muon is $\\tau = 2.2\\times 10^{-6}$ seconds, which means that a typical muon survives only a small fraction of a second after being produced, ultimately decaying into an electron and neutrinos. (For the curious reader, more information about muons can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon).)\n",

In fact, many high-energy muons are able to penetrate a good distance into the Earth, which is the reason why some experiments need to be done at laboratories [deep underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOLAB). On the other hand, cosmic ray muons can also be very useful, allowing us to see places that are inaccessible.\n",
